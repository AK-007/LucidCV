CV Maker as the name suggests, is a simple CV maker which collects data from the user and creates a CV for the user.
It is under development so it doesnt have much features.I will be adding more features in the coming days.
Those who wish to contribute are welcome :smile: .

## How to setup locally

* Install nodejs and npm
* run `git clone https://github.com/aswinzz/CV-Maker.git`
* Enter into the cloned folder
* run `sudo npm install`
* run `sudo npm start`
* Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser

## How It Works

The user enters the data and after the form is submitted a json file is created and depending on the selected theme and the json data CV is prepared.

## TODO

* Add more themes
* Make the CV downloadable
* Add user feature to save the user data
